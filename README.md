# work_improvement
This repo contains files that I've created to automate some tasks at my current work place.

At "excel_VBScript" you can find my excel files that extract data from csv files created from one 
instrument to be read by other machines by creating a new file with the data extracted.

At "windows_batch" you can find a .bat file that automatically creates folders for the year entered as input.
Inside the Year folder it creates a folder for the Months, and inside the month it has a folder for each day based on the month.
Leap year is also considered which means it will create a folder for the 29th of February, if the year is a leap year.
