This program was created while working at Synnovis. (2023)

In the lab we create reports for everything to ensure that everything can be traced back.
Each year there was an apointed person to mannually create folders for each day of the month based on the year in the form of "\year\mm month\ddmmyyyy"
where mm is the number of the month (i.e. 01 Jan, 02 Feb,etc..), dd is the day, mm the month, and yyyy the year.
It needs to fllow this format because other programs are configured to look on these specific directories.
Since I became the appointed person to create them I decided to create a program that would create this for me, 
so I took a few hours on my own to learn about the command line and how to automate commands.
On my second day of study I had already created the file "daily_folder_by_year.bat" and is now the one in use at the lab.

Take a look :)
